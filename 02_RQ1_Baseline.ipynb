        "1. Model accuracy tends to degrade as network depth increases. Based on the **Residual Learning** framework proposed by He et al. (2016), the input is defined as $x$, the desired underlying mapping is $H(x)$, and ResNet is set to directly learn the **Residual function** $F(x) = H(x) - x$ instead of $H(x)$. The final output is formulated as $H(x) = F(x) + x$. This design allows gradients to flow directly through shallower operations, thus making it possible to train a deep learning network of $101$ layers.\n",
        "2. Since medical image data is relatively scarce compared to the $14$ million images in ImageNet, training from scratch easily leads to overfitting. Therefore, the pre-trained weights from ImageNet will be utilized as a **Feature Extractor** for the discussion concerning **Texture Bias** in RQ2.

Since the weights of ResNet-101 ($\\theta_{pre}$) have been thoroughly trained on ImageNet, its Filters already possess proficient edge and texture detection capabilities. If a standard learning rate (e.g., $10^{-3}$) is set, a large gradient update magnitude ($\\Delta \\theta$) may damage the pre-trained feature extraction layers.\n",
        "3. Since there exists an extreme class imbalance in the dataset, for example, the weight of Dementia Moderate is as high as 55, the model will be forced to Overfit the few photos of dementia in the training set. This results in a high training accuracy, but very unstable validation accuracy. When the model encounters a photo with a weight of 55 and makes a prediction error, the loss will instantly increase by 55 times, causing the gradient during backpropagation to also increase by 55 times, leading to a drastic change in the model's weights, resulting in unstable validation accuracy. At this time, `clipnorm` can be used to clip the gradient."

        "\n",
        "    * The statistical result showing a Leakage Ratio of **$100.00\\%$** in the Flawed Baseline confirms that every patient whose images were in the Validation Set also had images present in the Training Set.\n",
        "    * Because ResNet-101 has strong feature extraction capabilities, when the test set contains known patients, the classification task essentially degrades into learning **patient identity features** (such as skull shape, cerebral gyrus texture), rather than learning **dementia pathological features** (such as ventricular enlargement) which are relevant to disease diagnosis.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. **Conclusion of RQ1**\n",
        "\n",
        "    This experiment confirms the argument by **Wen et al. (2020)** that the high accuracies ($>99\\%$) commonly seen on datasets like Kaggle or OASIS do not stem from the model learning pathological features, but are rather a statistical artifact caused by the **Lack of Subject-level Independence**.\n",
        "\n",
        "    The only explanation for the inflated accuracy is that the model is doing Re-identification, rather than Disease Classification.\n",
        "\n",
        "    The **65.72% accuracy of the Strict Baseline** represents the true lower bound of the ResNet-101 model's actual performance in a realistic clinical setting when dealing with unseen patients. This conclusion also provides a comparable baseline with room for improvement for the subsequent feature augmentation experiments in RQ2."
