The content and results presented in this presentation constitute an exploratory research study whose findings have not yet undergone complete peer review.

This research is intended for academic discussion only and does not constitute any form of clinical diagnosis or medical advice.

## Acknowledgments

The author gratefully acknowledges the following resources:

-   The dataset used in this study is provided by the OASIS dataset from [OASIS Alzheimer's Detection](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/ninadaithal/imagesoasis/code) on Kaggle.

### Information from the Kaggle Page

-   The dataset used is the [OASIS MRI dataset](https://sites.wustl.edu/oasisbrains/), which consists of 80,000 brain MRI images. The images have been divided into four classes based on Alzheimer's progression. The dataset aims to provide a valuable resource for analyzing and detecting early signs of Alzheimer's disease.
